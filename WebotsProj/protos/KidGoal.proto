# Modified: 12 JUNE 2008: added a bounding object for the net
# Modified: 29 OCTOBER 2009: Reviewed by Yvan Bourquin - www.cyberbotics.com
#  -merged various IndexFaceSet for better performance
#  -fixed unwanted black color in support triangles
# Modified: 22 APRIL 2010: by Yvan Bourquin - www.cyberbotics.com
#  -modified to hold net 350 mm back from posts (according to SPL 2010 specs)
#  -removed unused Shapes/Materials in boundingObject
#
#  NSL goal: 80 by 150 (inner size)
